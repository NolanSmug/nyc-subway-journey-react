## How to play
You are placed into a random NYC subway station. Your objective is to reach another randomly given station by utilizing your knowledge of the NYC subway system.

### Initialization
1. **Random starting point:**
- At the beginning of the game, you are assigned:
  - A `starting station` 
  - A `destination station` (see [all_stations.csv](./public/csv/all_stations.csv))
  - A `starting line` (e.g., A, 2, N,...)
2. **Choosing a direction:**
- Before you can move, you must choose a `starting direction` (e.g. UPTOWN, DOWNTOWN) by either: 
   - Clicking the `[Toggle direction]` text on the subway car, or 
   - Clicking `Change direction` button. 
- The `Advance` button will remain disabled until a direction is chosen.
     > If you want, you may transfer to a different line before selecting a direction.
3. **Ready to move:**
- Once a direction is selected, you are able to `Advance` and `Transfer`. 

### Gameplay

1. **Navigating the subway:**
- The game UI displays your `current station` and `destination station`. Like you would in real life, use the according actions to progress:

   **Buttons:**
  -  `Advance station` – Advance 1 station (see `conductor mode` to control this value)
  -  `Change direction` – Reverses your current direction. Each line has specific `UPTOWN` and `DOWNTOWN` labels.
  -  `Transfer lines` –  Click on a subway line at your `current station` to switch to that line and continue your journey in the same direction.
      > **Note:** Using this button is optional. You can directly click on a subway line icon at the current station to switch to it as well.
  - `Refresh` – Refreshes the current game with new starting and destination stations.  
<br>

2. **Goal:**
- Successfully navigate from your starting station to your destination station by advancing through stations and transferring train lines as needed. Be mindful of your `current direction` throughout as well.
  
### Configuration settings
- **`Theme`** – Toggle light/dark mode
- **`Upcoming stations`** – Toggle upcoming stations visibility
- **`Upcoming stations layout`** – Toggle the upcoming stations view between vertical or horizontal
- **`Conductor mode`** – Enable conductor mode (default is rider mode)


### Conductor mode
Think of conductor mode as a sort of a professional feature mode. When enabled, users are able to:  

1. Advance an input number of stations (with "reset to 1" button)
2. Configure the "default" `starting direction` upon completing a transfer
   - `Uptown`
   - `Select direction` (user is given choice of direction each time)
   - `Downtown`
3. View all available [keyboard shortcuts](#keyboard-shortcuts)

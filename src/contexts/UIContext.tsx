    //
    // 1. The location of the stations bar isn't a boolean, it's a choice from
    //    a known set of options. Horizontal isn't the opposite of vertical,
    //    something not being vertical doesn't imply that it's horizontal.
    //
    // 2. Later you might have another place you need to put it.
    //
    // 3. Not showing it is just another way of rendering it
    //
    // 4. It's possible to represent the status bar not being drawn in two 
    //    different locations this way
    //
    // If you were now showing the status bar because you're in a modal ui
    // where it isn't relevant, then "visible" might be ok. But in that case,
    // I would then prefer that it be inferred enum for the modes.
    //
    // The visibility of the stations thing semantically isn't something that
    // exists in isolation in your application. This structurally leads to
    // your settings menu having both "Upcoming stations" and "Upcoming stations layout"
    // which isn't obvious what they do. Horizontal, Vertical and Hidden are 
    // 3 options you have for the display location of the line and they should
    // be displayed in a way that communicates that relationship in your settings menu.
    // A tri-modal button maybe?
